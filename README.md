## Experiments and Useful things for working with the Carla simulator

The CARLA automotive simulator is a fantastic tool for experimenting with vehicle behaviours.  However, to use it, you need to be able to access the maps, waypoints, and other parts, pull them all out, and understand how they work.  This repository is a collection of tools and experiments that are written with just that in mind.  Enjoy.
